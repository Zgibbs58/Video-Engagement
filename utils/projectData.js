    fullDescription:
      "AstronoME is a web app that shows the user a dashboard of information that can help them with their stargazing ventures. Most of the features require a valid account, however there is a landing page that shows Incoming Asteroid data and a Daily image from NASA. Once the user signs up for an account they can see the weather and moon phase for their location and they gain access to the AstronoME community via a forum of stargazers. This is a MERN application that utilizes GraphQL and Apollo Server to efficiently fetch and manipulate data. This was a group project that was made up of 6 developers. My main contributions to the project were the fetching and rendering of NASA API data on the dashboard, researching and incorporating Cloudinary to handle uploading images with a post to be rendered on the community page, and UI/UX bug fixes.",
